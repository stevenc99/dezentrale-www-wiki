# Roadmap

## Eintragung des e.V.

Done!

## Finanzamt decision on Gemeinnützigkeit

Finanzamt made a preliminary reading of our draft Satzung and wrote to us that it bespeaks Gemeinnützigkeit.

We have sent them the final version and wait to hear back from them.

## [[Girokonto]]

At Sparkasse Leipzig, we need to update the account name from "dezentrale" -> "dezentrale e.V." (need to show them to Vereinsregisterauszug).

Now that we are an e.V., we can consider other banks too (e.g. GLS-Bank, Fidor).

## Vereinsräume

We have a location!  We need to make it ready to receive guests ([[WelcomeParty]])

### Strom

We need to register with the Stadtwerke, and must agree the tariff with the Holzwerkstatt.

### Internet

Useful thing for a hackerspace.  We could order ADSL/VDSL from Vodafone/Telekom.

steven is also trying to find a temporary solution.

### Door/entry system
