## Domain name

### dezentrale.space

it is paid up until 2022-06-11T23:59:59.0Z, as a donation, and now it is legally owned by the e.V.

## DNS hosting

(temporarily?) being provided by the domain registrar Gandi.net, free of charge, but we could set up something better (with DNSSEC) one day

## VPSes

lokke and steven both have root access

steven pays for the host machine at Hetzner, but the e.V. should someday replace it (when it is registered, and has money, and maybe some servers on-site)

Both VPSes have IPv6, and a directly routed IPv4 address each.  Reverse DNS for IPv6 and IPv4 are correctly set up to match the hostname.

SPF allows "A" and "MX" entries to send mail from @dezentrale.space.  Mailman changes "Sender:" to the mailing list's address, so that it passes SPF checks (but not DKIM).

TODO: emails for root/listmaster/webmaster are not currently going anywhere...

NTP is set up already on the host machine (so it is not needed inside of the VPSes).

Certbot runs every few days via Cron, it should automatically renew the SSL certificates from LetsEncrypt.org every 2-3 months

Qualys SSL Server Test:

TODO: we redirect from http: to https:, but don't set any HSTS headers yet.

/etc on all servers is tracked inside Git (by etckeeper)

Ikiwiki tracks its content in Git (and configuration?)

TODO: build the main website

TODO: also put the website, mailman configurations into Git repositories

TODO: distribute the Git repositories somewhere (ideally can all be public, because passwords and private keys are excluded)

TODO: back up private data (e.g. list archives) somewhere secure

TODO: document how to rebuild the entire machines from backups, and actually test this
