# Infrastructure

## Domain name

### dezentrale.space

paid by steven, who will transfer ownership to the e.V. as soon as that is registered (I need the Registernummer first)

it is paid up until 2022-06-11T23:59:59.0Z, as a non-refundable donation

## DNS hosting

(temporarily) served by the domain registrar Gandi.net, but we could set up something better (with DNSSEC)

## VPSes

lokke and steven both have root access

steven is paying for the host machine at Hetzner, but the e.V. should someday take over it (when it is registered, and has money, or maybe servers on-site)

Both VPSes have IPv6, and a directly routed IPv4 address.  Reverse DNS for IPv6 and IPv4 are set to match the hostname.

SPF allows "A" and "MX" entries to send mail from @dezentrale.space.  Mailman changes "Sender:" to the mailing list's address, so this passes SPF (but not DKIM).

TODO: emails for root/listmaster/webmaster are not currently going anywhere...

NTP is set up already on the host machine (not needed inside of the VPSes).

Certbot runs every few days via Cron, it should automatically renew the SSL certificates from LetsEncrypt.org

TODO: (someday) OCSP stapling, if Apache supports it, otherwise consider Nginx for this purpose

TODO: we redirect from http: to https:, but don't set HSTS headers yet.

/etc is tracked in Git (by etckeeper)

Ikiwiki tracks content in Git (and configuration?)

TODO: build the main website

TODO: also put the website, mailman configurations into Git repositories

TODO: distribute the Git repositories somewhere (ideally can all be public, because passwords and private keys are excluded)

TODO: back up other data (e.g. list archives) somewhere secure

TODO: document how to rebuild the entire machines from backups

## [[Girokonto]]

It is likely that at least two of the BGB-Vorstand will have access to Online Banking; and EC-Karte for Barabholung or Ausz√ºge from the Automat.

Anyone can pay in cash at Reisebank (Leipzig HbF), directly into that bank account, but it's important to give a receipt to the Schatzmeister.  To avoid fees, maybe only do this 4 times per year.
