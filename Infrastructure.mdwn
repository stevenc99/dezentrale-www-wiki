# Infrastructure

## Domain name

### dezentrale.space

paid by steven, who will transfer ownership to the e.V. as soon as that is registered (I need the Registernummer first)

it is paid up until 2022-06-11T23:59:59.0Z, as a non-refundable donation

## DNS hosting

(temporarily) served by the domain registrar Gandi.net, but we could set up something better (with DNSSEC)

## VPSes

lokke and steven both have root access

steven is paying for the host machine at Hetzner, but the e.V. should someday take over it (when it is registered, and has money, or maybe servers on-site)

/etc is tracked in Git (by etckeeper)

Ikiwiki tracks content in Git (and configuration?)

TODO: build the main website

TODO: also put the website, mailman configurations into Git repositories

TODO: distribute the Git repositories somewhere (ideally can all be public, because passwords and private keys are excluded)

TODO: back up other data (e.g. list archives) somewhere secure

TODO: document how to rebuild the entire machines from backups

### www.dezentrale.space

https://dezentrale.space - main website

https://dezentrale.space/wiki/ - Ikiwiki, all of Vorstand have admin accounts already

https://dezentrale.space/munin/ - operational stats

### lists.dezentrale.space

https://lists.dezentrale.space - mailman web interface

## [[Girokonto]]

It is likely that at least two of the BGB-Vorstand will have access to Online Banking; and EC-Karte for Barabholung or Ausz√ºge from the Automat.

Anyone can pay in cash at Reisebank (Leipzig HbF), directly into that bank account, but it's important to give a receipt to the Schatzmeister.  To avoid fees, maybe only do this 4 times per year.
