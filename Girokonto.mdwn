If we open a bank account _now_, we can start to collect Mitgliderschaftsbeitrag and other donations already.  We can start to save up the money for Kaution.

We are still an "n.e.V." - a nicht-eingetragene Verein.  We become an "e.V." when we are registered with the Amtsgericht;  that may happen sometime in July, but not before.

Some banks allow a "n.e.V." to get an account:

  * GLS-Bank - might be possible, but not online

  * Skatbank (part of Volksbank-Raiffeisenbank e.G.) - possible online

  * Sparkasse Leipzig - possible according to their website, but they told Georg we should wait until we are a registered "e.V."

When we are an "e.V.", many more options will be available to us:

  * GLS-Bank - possible online

  * Skatbank - possible online

  * Sparkasse Leipzig - possible online or in-branch
